### What is Ethereum Classic?

Ethereum Classic is a secure, censorproof, reliable, public, trustless and
decentralized platform for running applications.

### How is Ethereum Classic related to Ethereum?

To understand the relationship it is important to know the history.  It is
especially important to be familiar with the [DAO
attack](http://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists) and how the
Ethereum Foundation responded to it.  Also, it is important to be familiar with
the strong objections described in the [Ethereum Classic Declaration Of
Independence](https://ethereumclassic.github.io/assets/ETC_Declaration_of_Independence.pdf).

### How is Ethereum Classic related to Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was the first blockchain application.  Ethereum Classic is a general
blockchain platform to run many more types of applications than Bitcoin can.

### What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a special type of distributed database.  The most significant
attribute of blockchains is that no one controls them!  There is no one
everybody needs to trust to manage it.  That is why they are referred to as
being trustless.  Users submit tasks in *transactions* that are grouped into
*blocks* that are linked together to form *chains*.

### What is a smart contract?

Smart contracts are computer systems that manage assets such as automatic teller
machines and the Bitcoin system.  Ethereum Classic is able to run many types of
smart contracts.  If Ethereum Classic smart contracts are not mainly
financial, it makes more sense to emphasize their autonomy by
referring to them as *agents*.

### What is ether?

Ether and ETC denote the native cryptocurrency used to pay for tasks
such as installing new smart contracts.

### What is gas?

Gas is a made up unit used to denote the amount of *resources* required to do
tasks such as installing new smart contracts.

### What is a dapp?

A dapp is a decentralized application.  They are also referred to as smart
contracts on the Ethereum Classic system.  The term is used to distinguish
applications that run on blockchains from centralized applications.

### How do I create a dapp?

To create a dapp for Ethereum Classic you must program one in a smart contract
programming language.  Then, you must compile that dapp and install it on the
blockchain from a funded account.

### How do I purchase ether for an account?

You can purchase ether on several *exchanges*.  You can also *mine* for ether.

### What smart contract programming languages are there?

Solidity is similar to Javascript and the most popular.  Serpent is
similar to Python and also available.  LLL is yet another choice that is similar
to Lisp.  There are other smart contract languages being developed as well.

### Mining

---

&nbsp;

### What is mining?

There are computational tasks involved in adding blocks of transactions to
the blockchain.  Computers on the Ethereum Classic network that voluntarily
perform these tasks get a reward of ether.  For security reasons, miners
compete to complete these tasks first and win these rewards.  This effort is
referred to as *mining*.

### What is proof of work information?

Mining involves doing computational tasks whose sole purpose is to
intentionally make mining difficult!  This difficulty is required to secure the
network against certain attacks.  These tasks involve finding certain numbers
related to each block.  These numbers are referred to as proof of work
information.

### What is a coinbase?

A coinbase is a special transaction, in every block, that creates new ether
added to an account selected by the miner of that block.  It can also refer
to the primary account of a user.

### What is an uncle?

Several miners compete to submit blocks to the blockchain.  Inevitably some
miners will lose the competition.  The blockchain references the losing blocks
to make the blockchain more secure.  These losing blocks that contribute to the
security of the blockchain are referred to as *uncles*.  The term comes from the
fact that blocks have preceding *parent* blocks. The losing blocks are not
parents but are still related to the parents.  Hence they are like uncles.
